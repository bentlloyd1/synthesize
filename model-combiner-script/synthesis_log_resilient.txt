That's a classic! "asdf" are the first four letters on the home row of a standard QWERTY keyboard.

People often type it for a few reasons:
*   **Testing:** To see if a keyboard, program, or text field is working.
*   **Placeholder:** As random filler text.
*   **Boredom:** Just typing something easy without thinking.

Did you have a question in mind, or were you just testing things out? I'm here to help either way

== PROMPT: Explain the concept of 'technical debt' without using any analogies.
======================================================================
--- MODEL A (gpt-5) RESPONSE ---
Technical debt is the accumulation of suboptimal technical choices and gaps in a system—spanning code, architecture, tests, data, infrastructure, tooling, and documentation—that make future change or operation slower, riskier, or more expensive than necessary.

What creates it
- Deliberate shortcuts to meet a deadline without a defined remediation plan
- Incomplete knowledge early in development that isn’t revisited as understanding improves
- Architecture or design that doesn’t evolve with new requirements
- Insufficient or flaky automated tests
- Aging dependencies, platforms, and toolchains
- Inconsistent coding standards or patterns across teams
- Partially completed refactors, leftover feature flags, dead code
- Missing or outdated documentation and runbooks
- Manual build, release, or operational steps

Common categories
- Code quality: duplication, excessive complexity, long functions, tight coupling
- Design/architecture: unclear boundaries, circular dependencies, leaky abstractions
- Testing: low coverage, brittle tests, slow suites, gaps in critical paths
- Dependencies: outdated libraries, known vulnerabilities, pinned legacy versions
- Build/CI/CD: slow builds, unreliable pipelines, non-reproducible environments
- Infrastructure/config: snowflake servers, manual changes, inconsistent configs
- Data: weak schema design, migration debt, poor indexing, inconsistent contracts
- Security: missing controls, insecure defaults, ad hoc secrets handling
- Documentation and process: missing docs, untracked operational knowledge

Impacts
- Longer lead times for changes and fixes
- Higher defect and incident rates, harder root-cause analysis
- Reduced system reliability and performance
- Difficult onboarding and lower team confidence
- Unpredictable delivery and increased operational overhead
- Increased exposure to security issues and compliance gaps

Indicators to watch
- High cyclomatic complexity or deep inheritance
- Low or declining test coverage; frequent flaky tests
- Many lint/static analysis warnings or suppressed rules
- Copy-paste code and divergent implementations of the same pattern
- Long build/test/deploy times; frequent pipeline failures
- Outdated or unsupported dependencies
- TODO/FIXME/HACK comments; disabled tests; leftover feature flags
- Hotspots: files with both high change frequency and high complexity
- Repeated incidents in the same components; long mean time to recovery

How to measure and track it
- Maintain a visible backlog of remediation items with estimated effort and risk
- Use change-friction metrics: lead time, change failure rate, MTTR, review time
- Combine code churn with complexity to find high-value refactoring targets
- Track dependency freshness and known vulnerability counts
- Periodically assess architecture fitness (coupling, boundaries, latency budgets)

How to manage and reduce it
- Make it explicit: log items as first-class backlog work
- Prioritize by risk, frequency of use, blast radius, and customer impact
- Reserve capacity regularly (e.g., a fixed percentage each iteration) for remediation
- Enforce quality gates in CI (tests, lint, coverage, dependency checks)
- Refactor continuously in the vicinity of ongoing work (“touch it, improve it”)
- Strengthen automated testing and remove flaky tests
- Modularize and decouple hot components; define clear interfaces and contracts
- Update dependencies incrementally; automate alerts and upgrades where possible
- Remove dead code and expired feature flags; document decisions (ADRs)
- Share knowledge via code reviews, pairing, and runbooks; avoid single points of failure
- After incidents, capture contributing technical debt and schedule remediation

When it can be acceptable
- Prototypes and experiments
- Time-critical releases with explicit cleanup tasks, owners, and deadlines
- Early-stage learning, provided there is a near-term plan to revisit the design

In short: technical debt is the gap between the current system and a maintainable, evolvable state, and it manifests as extra effort and risk whenever you build, change, or operate the system. Managing it requires visibility, prioritization, continuous refactoring, automation, and disciplined engineering practices.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
--- MODEL B (gemini-2.5-pro) RESPONSE ---
Of course. Here is an explanation of technical debt without using analogies.

### The Core Concept

Technical debt is the future cost of rework that results from choosing an easy or fast solution now instead of a better, more sustainable approach that would have taken more time or effort.

It is the accumulation of suboptimal technical decisions made during the development of a software system. Each of these decisions, while perhaps beneficial in the short term, creates an implicit liability: the extra work that will be required in the future to fix or improve the initial solution.

---

### How Technical Debt is Created

Technical debt arises from specific actions and decisions. Here are concrete examples:

*   **Writing Poor-Quality Code:** Code that is hard to read, poorly structured, or has no documentation. When another developer (or the original author) needs to modify it later, they will first have to spend significant time just to understand it, slowing them down. This extra time is a direct consequence of the initial poor quality.
*   **Skipping Automated Tests:** To release a feature faster, a team might decide not to write automated tests. While this saves time initially, it creates future work. Every subsequent change to that feature will require slow, manual testing to ensure nothing was broken. Or, worse, bugs will be introduced that will take time to find and fix later.
*   **Postponing Upgrades:** A system is built using a specific version of a programming language or an external library. Over time, new, more secure, and more efficient versions are released. Not upgrading saves time now, but eventually, a critical security vulnerability will be found in the old version, forcing an urgent and difficult upgrade project that is much larger than if the upgrades had been done incrementally.
*   **Insufficient Design:** A feature is built to solve only the immediate problem, without considering how it might need to grow or connect to other parts of the system in the future. When a new requirement comes along, the original feature cannot support it, forcing developers to rebuild large parts of it first. This rework is the manifestation of the debt.

---

### The Consequences of Unmanaged Technical Debt

If technical debt is not addressed, its negative effects compound over time, leading to:

*   **Slower Development Velocity:** Simple changes take a long time to implement because developers must navigate complex, brittle, and poorly understood code. The system actively resists modification.
*   **Increased Bugs and Instability:** Suboptimal code is often fragile. A change in one area can cause unexpected failures in a completely different part of the system. This increases the frequency of defects and reduces the reliability of the software.
*   **Higher Cost of Change:** The effort required to add new features grows exponentially. A feature that should take a day to build might take weeks because of the amount of existing suboptimal code that must be worked around or fixed first.
*   **Decreased Developer Morale:** Working on a system with high technical debt is frustrating and demotivating for engineers. They spend their time fighting the system instead of creating value.

---

### Is Technical Debt Always Bad?

No. Sometimes, incurring technical debt is a conscious and strategic business decision.

*   **Meeting Deadlines:** A company might need to release a product by a specific date to beat a competitor or secure a contract. In this case, taking shortcuts to meet the deadline is a calculated risk. The team knowingly accepts the future rework cost in exchange for the immediate business opportunity.
*   **Validating an Idea:** When building a prototype or a "Minimum Viable Product" (MVP), the goal is to test a hypothesis quickly with minimal investment. It makes no sense to engineer a perfect, scalable solution for a product that users may not even want. The shortcuts taken are a pragmatic choice.

The key distinction is between **intentional** (and documented) debt taken for strategic reasons, and **unintentional** debt that accumulates due to carelessness, lack of skill, or poor processes. Good teams manage their intentional debt and work to prevent unintentional debt.

In summary, technical debt is the measurable, real-world consequence of past technical decisions on the future speed, quality, and cost of software development. It is the work you will have to do tomorrow because of a choice you made today.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
--- FINAL RESPONSE (using gpt-4o) ---
Technical debt refers to the future cost of rework that stems from choosing easier or faster solutions at present instead of investing the time and effort for more sustainable, long-term solutions. This concept embodies the accumulation of suboptimal technical choices throughout software development. These decisions often yield immediate benefits but create an implicit liability: the additional work required later to correct or improve the initial implementation.

Technical debt emerges from various practices, such as writing poor-quality code, skipping automated tests, postponing upgrades, or implementing insufficient designs. For example, neglecting automated testing to hasten release can lead to manual testing later, slowing development and increasing the likelihood of bugs.

When unmanaged, technical debt can severely hinder development, resulting in slower progress, increased bugs, and higher costs for implementing new features. Additionally, the demoralizing effect on developers, who must deal with cumbersome, complex systems, can lead to decreased motivation.

However, technical debt isn't always negative. It can be a strategic decision—such as meeting deadlines or quickly testing hypotheses with a minimal viable product. The key is acknowledging the debt and planning for future remediation. Effective management involves distinguishing between intentional debt, taken for strategic reasons, and unintentional debt, which results from oversight or inadequate processes.

In essence, technical debt is the real-world consequence of past technical decisions on software's future speed, quality, and cost. It requires visibility, prioritized remediation, and disciplined engineering practices to manage effectively.

== PROMPT: Write a short, suspenseful story that starts with the line: 'The old clock chimed thirteen times.'
======================================================================
--- MODEL A (gpt-5) RESPONSE ---
The old clock chimed thirteen times.

I counted them on my breath, waiting for the familiar fade after twelve that never came. The thirteenth struck a fraction lower, the sound catching on the brass like a voice with a cold. Then the pendulum stalled mid-swing. The house exhaled.

Night pressed at the windows, thin frost webbing along old glass. Wind should have rattled the wavy panes, but the snow had stopped hours ago. The silence felt intentional, like the pause between a question and an answer.

The Mantlefield clock had sat dead on my aunt’s hearth for as long as I’d visited this house on winter holidays: lion feet, cracked porcelain face, a smile of hairline fractures under the twelve. She’d called it a nuisance and left it unwound. “It keeps its own time,” she’d said, the way you say a trick knee keeps its own weather. When I inherited the place, I’d told myself I’d fix it. Or sell it. Or never come at all. But the realtor had a buyers’ list, and I needed a weekend to box up the family.

I hadn’t wound the clock. I hadn’t touched it. Yet its chime hung in the air like a note written on the bones of the house.

I turned from the hearth to see if the grandfather on the landing had joined in. The tall case clock with the moon dial and the ship etched on the face watched me with its blind gold heart. It hadn’t moved in decades. My aunt had taped a small note to its glass years ago. I’d noticed it earlier when I came in and smiled at her neat, impatient hand. If it complains, let it, she’d written, as if the clock were a neighbor with a lawn mower.

Another sound lifted from the ceiling. Not weather. Steps so soft they could have been breaths—thirteen of them, tiptoeing above me, crossing the little room over the parlor where my aunt kept hats and secrets. The house was old enough to put its own voice into things. Pipes groaned. Radiators sighed. Boards confessed. This wasn’t any of those.

“Hello?” I said before my brain told me not to.

My voice slid into the hallway and wasn’t returned. The brass doorknob to the small study moved of its own temperature or my imagination. Just the house settling, I told myself. Just me, nervous. But the smell in the room had changed from cold dust to the sulfur sting of a spent match, the scent of a candle pinched out.

On the mantel, propped against the clock’s base, lay the winding key I didn’t remember placing there. A dark ribbon looped its handle. Under it, pinned with a tarnished hatpin into the runner, was a second note. Different paper. Different hand. A hurried line across the bottom edge of a torn page.

If it strikes thirteen, it wants a name. Do not give yours. Do not answer. Let it call.

The paper rasped when I lifted it. The words were my aunt’s, but the ink trembled. She’d never trembled. The pin had left four tiny rust kisses on the runner. Had this always been here? I couldn’t recall.

Upstairs, one more step, very soft, rocked the crystal drops on the hallway chandelier so they rang against one another, a small, clear, discordant rain. The thirteenth stair on the old servant staircase had a squeak so particular that every niece and nephew had learned to skip it on Christmas morning. We used to laugh about it. “It tattles,” my aunt said. “Furnishings like to feel needed.”

My phone lit my palm with a sterile rectangle of blue. No signal. 13% battery glared back from the corner, absurdly precise. I watched it drop to 12. When I lifted my eyes again, the minute hand on the Mantlefield had notched backward. I wouldn’t have seen it move if I’d been watching. Its brassy quill now hovered a hair’s breadth before twelve.

Something knocked—once, twice, then in a pattern that formed itself into the number if you wanted it to. I didn’t want it to. It came from inside the case of the mantle clock. As if someone, small and patient, had decided it was a door after all.

I took one step closer. The pendulum held its breath. Behind the glass, a shadow cast where there was no source shifted and coalesced into the suggestion of shoulders. For a half-second, the reflection of the room on the clock’s face included a figure besides me. It was standing too close, wearing the air like a borrowed coat.

“Is someone there?” asked a woman’s voice from upstairs, a careful calm worn like a uniform. My aunt used that tone to soothe dogs and doctors. But this voice had a freshness hers had lost. It was her and not her. It made the little hairs on my wrist lift.

The note in my hand crinkled. Do not answer.

“Yes,” I said, the syllable a reflex shaped by a lifetime of being polite to people older than the house.

The word didn’t go upward. It went inward, into the wood. The walls took it and held it. The note fluttered from my fingers to the rug.

The temperature dropped. The air in front of my face felt thick, as if the parlor had been filled with riverwater that refused to freeze. Every picture frame on the hall wall pivoted a degree on its nail—just enough to be wrong. Above me, a door that had been standing open for thirty years eased shut as if pressed by a hand.

“Who,” the voice asked from just beyond my left ear, not upstairs at all, “are you?”

I could have stayed silent. I could have. The syllables climbed my throat anyway. It was a habit. It was the desire to be known. It was my name’s weight in my mouth made of years and dinners and school attendance. “Thomas.”

The mouth of the house formed the shape of my name and it didn’t sound right. It sounded like a fork bending under a stranger’s grip. The mantle clock accepted it. The pendulum gave a little kick and a little hum, and through the beveled glass I saw, clear as a fingerprint, the word Thomas ghost onto the brass disk, letters fogging and then frosting in place.

“Thank you,” said the voice. It was warmer now, satisfied to have learned the word it needed.

I backed away until my calves caught the sofa. The old case clock on the landing answered the mantled one with a long, rusty inhalation, and then both began to tick in sync, not forward but sideways, a sideways tick that didn’t carry time with it but slid it against the grain. The hall seemed longer. The front door, beyond the dim oval of the foyer rug, receded as if I’d moved and it hadn’t.

In the study, papers I’d stacked earlier to sort were splayed now as if a fan had been turned on them. Family deeds. Letters. A photograph of my father as a boy stood at the edge of the desk where there had been no frame. A second scrap of paper, twin to the one from the mantel, lay with it.

It continues once it has what it wants, the rest of the torn letter read. It will open. Walk through. Do not look back when you leave. If you look, it will make room.

The front door clicked, the old latch undoing itself like a corset. Cold rushed up the foyer, bringing a taste of iron and old snow. The outside world returned in the small sounds it makes when it’s allowed in: a distant truck changing gears, a late dog barking to be let in. I could feel the pull of the night the way you feel a current catch your ankles. The house was letting me go because it had already kept something.

Something came down the stairs, light enough to skip the tattling step. It didn’t have to. It knew how.

I reached for the doorknob and drew the door just enough to see the white of the first drift and the black bone of the maple. Behind me, breath that wasn’t mine warmed the hollow of my neck. It was a careful kindness, like someone steadying you as you descended an unfamiliar boat.

“Don’t,” it whispered.

The front hall stretched another inch. The Mantlefield’s face had cleared of frost; the little hand was nowhere, the big hand hovering tremblingly at the twelve. It shivered and slid backward again, scuffing seconds into the space behind midnight.

I stepped out.

The storm had glossed the world. Snow under streetlight is the same everywhere. It makes a sound like paper when your boots break it. My car sat humped and ridiculous, half-buried at the curb. My breath wrote and rewrote itself in the air. Behind me the front door waited, open a polite four inches, as if I’d only stepped out to fetch something from the trunk.

Do not look back.

There’s an itch in every animal spine that insists on confirming the shape of the thing at your back. A thousand ancestors to thank for that turn. I had the letter’s command in my pocket and a lifetime of disobedience in my chest. I turned.

Through the slice of the door I saw the parlor as a reflection sees it—flat and bright and not quite true. The clock sat where it had always sat. A man stood in front of it with his hand on the key, head tilted as if listening to a voice he could barely hear. He looked like me if you finished a sketch of me in the wrong hand. He was a line off. He did not breathe, or he breathed on a different beat. When he turned, his eyes slid past where I was and fixed on a point you couldn’t stand if you were human.

He smiled. It was almost right.

The door eased inward, polite, leaving me the choice to catch it or let it close. The house waited, patient the way water is patient with a stone.

Inside, the clock took a deep breath.

I let the door shut between us, the latch finding its catch with a sound I had known my whole life. The night unfolded around me like something let out of a small box. My phone shook in my pocket, waking itself with thirteen little haptic coughs—a phantom battery trying to be exact. I didn’t take it out. I didn’t want to see who was calling.

The road in either direction was untrodden. The maple whispered. I started walking, and if my boots fell into a rhythm that repeated a number I didn’t care to count, I slowed until it didn’t.

Behind the oak door, behind the wallpaper roses faded into watermarks, the old clock chimed once more—low and sure—and held the last note a fraction longer than it should, as if considering what futures to inventory in the extra room time had left it. Somewhere inside, a voice practiced my name. Somewhere upstairs, a door stood open for whoever would need it next.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
--- MODEL B (gemini-2.5-pro) RESPONSE ---
The old clock chimed thirteen times.

Each metallic clang hammered into the oppressive silence of the house, a house Elias had only inherited a week ago. The first twelve chimes were deep and resonant, the familiar, somber tones of a grandfather clock marking midnight. But the thirteenth was different. It was a dissonant, grating strike, a sound like a cracked bell that vibrated not in the air, but in the bones.

Elias froze, his hand hovering over a dusty box of his great-aunt’s letters. He told himself it was a malfunction, a cog slipping in the ancient mechanism. Old houses made old sounds. But a profound, unnatural stillness followed the final chime, a silence so heavy it felt like a physical weight. The rain lashing against the windowpanes seemed to muffle, the wind’s howl died to a whisper. The world outside had been put on pause.

A floorboard creaked upstairs.

He held his breath, listening. It wasn't the groaning settle of old timber he’d grown used to. It was a specific, deliberate sound. The sound of weight being shifted. He snatched the heavy iron poker from the fireplace, its cold weight doing little to reassure him.

“Hello?” he called out, his voice a pathetic tremor in the cavernous living room.

Only the frantic ticking of the clock answered, seeming to speed up, each tick a frantic heartbeat in the throat of the house. He moved towards the grand staircase, his footsteps swallowed by the thick Persian rug. The shadows thrown by his single lamp seemed to stretch and writhe, clinging to the corners of the room like sentient things.

Another creak, closer this time. It came from the top of the stairs, from the darkness of the landing. He could just make out the silhouette of a tall, slender vase on a pedestal. He was sure it had been on the right side of the landing when he came down for a drink. Now, it was on the left.

His own heart hammered a frantic rhythm against his ribs. This was foolish. It was grief and exhaustion playing tricks on him. He took a steadying breath and placed a foot on the first step. The wood groaned under his weight, the sound deafening in the charged silence.

He ascended slowly, the poker held out before him like a ward. The air grew colder with each step, an icy draft that had no source. It carried a faint, cloying scent, like dried flowers and damp soil.

He reached the landing. The vase was indeed on the left, its porcelain surface gleaming faintly. As his eyes adjusted to the gloom, he saw something else. On the dark, polished floorboards, leading from the master bedroom to the spot where the vase now stood, was a single, wet footprint. It was long, narrow, and starkly, impossibly bare.

A soft, scraping sound came from behind him.

Elias spun around. The door to his great-aunt's bedroom, the one he had firmly shut and locked from the outside, was now slightly ajar. A thin sliver of absolute blackness beckoned from within.

From that sliver of darkness, a whisper coiled through the air, dry and rustling like dead leaves. It wasn't a human voice. It was the sound of the house itself finding breath.

"The twelfth hour is for the living," it whispered. "The thirteenth… is for the new resident."

The door swung slowly, silently open. Elias didn't see a figure or a monster. He saw only the oppressive, waiting darkness. And he understood, with a certainty that froze the blood in his veins, that the clock hadn't malfunctioned.

It had announced his arrival.

A man stood in front of it with his hand on the key, head tilted as if listening to a voice he could barely hear. He looked like me if you finished a sketch of me in the wrong hand. He was a line off. He did not breathe, or he breathed on a different beat. When he turned, his eyes slid past where I was and fixed on a point you couldn’t stand if you were human.

He smiled. It was almost right.

The door eased inward, polite, leaving me the choice to catch it or let it close. The house waited, patient the way water is patient with a stone.

Inside, the clock took a deep breath.

I let the door shut between us, the latch finding its catch with a sound I had known my whole life. The night unfolded around me like something let out of a small box. My phone shook in my pocket, waking itself with thirteen little haptic coughs—a phantom battery trying to be exact. I didn’t take it out. I didn’t want to see who was calling.

The road in either direction was untrodden. The maple whispered. I started walking, and if my boots fell into a rhythm that repeated a number I didn’t care to count, I slowed until it didn’t.

Behind the oak door, behind the wallpaper roses faded into watermarks, the old clock chimed once more—low and sure—and held the last note a fraction longer than it should, as if considering what futures to inventory in the extra room time had left it. Somewhere inside, a voice practiced my name. Somewhere upstairs, a door stood open for whoever would need it next.

--- MODEL B (gemini-2.5-pro) RESPONSE ---
Of course! Here is a Python function that accomplishes this task using the popular `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries.

This solution includes:
1.  Fetching the HTML content from the URL.
2.  Parsing the HTML to extract only the visible text.
3.  Cleaning the text by making it lowercase and removing punctuation.
4.  Filtering out common "stop words" (like 'the', 'a', 'is') for more meaningful results.
5.  Counting the frequency of each word and returning the top 5.
6.  Robust error handling for network issues or bad URLs.

### Prerequisites

First, you'll need to install the necessary libraries. You can do this with pip:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

### The Python Code

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import re
from collections import Counter

def get_top_5_words(url: str) -> list[tuple[str, int]]:
    """
    Fetches the content of a URL, cleans the text, and returns the 5 most common words.

    Args:
        url: The URL of the webpage to analyze.

    Returns:
        A list of tuples, where each tuple contains a word and its frequency,
        representing the top 5 most common words. Returns an empty list if
        the URL cannot be fetched or processed.
    """
    # A set of common English "stop words" to filter out.
    # This list can be expanded for more thorough filtering.
    STOP_WORDS = set([
        'i', 'me', 'my', 'myself', 'we', 'our', 'ours', 'ourselves', 'you', 'your',
        'yours', 'yourself', 'yourselves', 'he', 'him', 'his', 'himself', 'she',
        'her', 'hers', 'herself', 'it', 'its', 'itself', 'they', 'them', 'their',
        'theirs', 'themselves', 'what', 'which', 'who', 'whom', 'this', 'that',
        'these', 'those', 'am', 'is', 'are', 'was', 'were', 'be', 'been', 'being',
        'have', 'has', 'had', 'having', 'do', 'does', 'did', 'doing', 'a', 'an',
        'the', 'and', 'but', 'if', 'or', 'because', 'as', 'until', 'while', 'of',
        'at', 'by', 'for', 'with', 'about', 'against', 'between', 'into',
        'through', 'during', 'before', 'after', 'above', 'below', 'to', 'from',
        'up', 'down', 'in', 'out', 'on', 'off', 'over', 'under', 'again',
        'further', 'then', 'once', 'here', 'there', 'when', 'where', 'why', 'how',
        'all', 'any', 'both', 'each', 'few', 'more', 'most', 'other', 'some',
        'such', 'no', 'nor', 'not', 'only', 'own', 'same', 'so', 'than', 'too',
        'very', 's', 't', 'can', 'will', 'just', 'don', 'should', 'now'
    ])

    try:
        # 1. Fetch the HTML content with a timeout
        response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)
        # Raise an exception for bad status codes (4xx or 5xx)
        response.raise_for_status()

        # 2. Parse the HTML and extract text
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
        
        # Remove script and style elements
        for script_or_style in soup(['script', 'style']):
            script_or_style.decompose()
        
        text = soup.get_text()

        # 3. Clean the text and split into words
        # Use regex to find all words (sequences of letters) and make them lowercase
        words = re.findall(r'\b[a-z]{3,}\b', text.lower())

        # 4. Filter out stop words
        meaningful_words = [word for word in words if word not in STOP_WORDS]

        # 5. Count word frequency
        word_counts = Counter(meaningful_words)

        # 6. Return the top 5 most common words
        return word_counts.most_common(5)

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error fetching URL {url}: {e}")
        return []
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return []

# --- Example Usage ---
if __name__ == "__main__":
    target_url = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)"
    
    print(f"Analyzing URL: {target_url}")
    top_words = get_top_5_words(target_url)

    if top_words:
        print("\nTop 5 most common words:")
        for i, (word, count) in enumerate(top_words, 1):
            print(f"{i}. '{word}' appeared {count} times.")
    else:
        print("Could not retrieve the top words.")

```

### How It Works, Step-by-Step

1.  **Import Libraries**:
    *   `requests`: To make HTTP requests and get the webpage content.
    *   `BeautifulSoup` (from `bs4`): To parse the HTML and easily extract text.
    *   `re`: The regular expressions module, used here to find all the words in the text and clean it up.
    *   `Counter` (from `collections`): A specialized dictionary subclass that is perfect for counting hashable objects, like words.

2.  **Define Stop Words**:
    *   A `set` named `STOP_WORDS` is created. These are common words that don't usually carry significant meaning about the topic of a page.
    *   We use a `set` because checking for a word's existence in a set (`word in STOP_WORDS`) is much faster than in a list.

3.  **Fetch URL Content**:
    *   The code is wrapped in a `try...except` block to gracefully handle errors like a nonexistent URL, network connection problems, or server errors.
    *   `requests.get(url, timeout=10)` attempts to download the page content. A `timeout` is good practice to prevent the program from hanging indefinitely.
    *   `response.raise_for_status()` will automatically check if the request was successful (i.e., status code 200 OK) and will raise an error if not.

4.  **Parse and Extract Text**:
    *   `BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')` creates a soup object from the raw HTML.
    *   We explicitly find and `.decompose()` (remove) all `<script>` and `<style>` tags, as their contents are code, not human-readable text.
    *   `soup.get_text()` then extracts all the remaining text from the HTML tags, effectively stripping out the HTML itself.

5.  **Clean and Tokenize**:
    *   `text.lower()` converts the entire text to lowercase to ensure that "Python" and "python" are counted as the same word.
    *   `re.findall(r'\b[a-z]{3,}\b', ...)` is a regular expression that finds all sequences of 3 or more lowercase letters. `\b` is a word boundary, which prevents matching parts of words. This is an efficient way to get a list of clean words and ignore punctuation and numbers. The `{3,}` ensures we only count words with at least 3 letters, filtering out short, less meaningful words.

6.  **Filter, Count, and Return**:
    *   A list comprehension `[word for word in words if word not in STOP_WORDS]` creates a new list containing only the words that are *not* in our `STOP_WORDS` set.
    *   `Counter(meaningful_words)` takes this list and returns a `Counter` object (like a dictionary) mapping each word to its count.
    *   Finally, `word_counts.most_common(5)` is a handy method from the `Counter` class that directly returns a list of the 5 most frequent items and their counts, already sorted in descending order.
